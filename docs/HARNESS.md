# kobe — Agent Harness

> Read [`PLAN.md`](./PLAN.md) and [`DESIGN.md`](./DESIGN.md) first.

> **What this is**: the contract every stream agent and team agent operates under. The point is to let agents self-validate and self-commit in a Ralph Loop, so the human (Jackson) only intervenes on **architectural decisions and blockers**, not on routine "did your code compile" checks.

---

## Principle

> If a fact about your code can be verified by running a command, the agent — not the human — runs that command.

The human's time goes to: design, taste calls, scope decisions, blockers the agent has tried 3+ times to resolve without progress.

The agent's time goes to: write → run → fail → fix → re-run → commit.

This is the Ralph Loop: tight, autonomous, evidence-based iteration.

---

## The five checks (every stream must pass before committing)

Every commit produced by an agent must be preceded by these checks, all green:

```bash
# 1. Type contract
bun run typecheck

# 2. Lint / format
bun run lint        # if a lint script exists; otherwise skip with note

# 3. Unit / component tests for the stream's scope
bun run test         # full suite OR scoped: bun run test src/<stream-dir>

# 4. Smoke test (if the stream produces a runnable artifact)
timeout 5 bun run dev   # exit 0 or 124 (timeout) is OK; 1 is a fail

# 5. *** BEHAVIORAL SELF-TEST *** — the agent runs the actual product and
#     verifies the feature works end-to-end. NO HUMAN IN THE LOOP.
bun run test:behavior   # see §Behavioral self-test below
```

Streams that don't produce runnables (e.g. types-only) skip check 4 and 5.

A stream is **green** when all applicable checks above pass on a clean checkout. The agent commits on green and only on green.

---

## Behavioral self-test — the load-bearing principle

> Unit tests prove the code compiles. Behavioral self-tests prove the *product* works. The agent runs the product itself, drives it, and asserts visible behavior — without asking the human to "click around and check."

This is the single most important property of this harness. If an agent only runs `bun test` and skips behavioral verification, it has not validated its work. It has validated some functions.

### What it looks like

A behavioral test:
1. **Spawns the kobe binary** (or a stream-scoped subset of it) in a controlled environment — PTY or tmux.
2. **Sends inputs** as a real user would: keystrokes, terminal resize events, etc.
3. **Captures the visible screen** at known points (after each input, or after a short settle).
4. **Asserts on visible state**: text present, panes laid out, status badges correct.
5. **Tears down** the process cleanly.

```ts
// example shape — concrete API defined in Stream 0.4
test("sidebar reflects new task immediately", async () => {
  const k = await spawnKobe({ cwd: tmpRepo, fakeEngine: scriptedNoOp });
  await k.sendKeys("n");                            // open new-task dialog
  await k.typeText("test task");
  await k.sendKeys("Enter");
  const screen = await k.capture();
  expect(screen).toContain("test task");
  expect(screen).toContain("In progress");
  await k.exit();
});
```

### Why this is non-negotiable

- The user has explicitly stated: tests must verify *product behavior*, not just *function correctness*. Compilers don't catch "the sidebar doesn't update when a task is created." Behavioral tests do.
- A green typecheck + passing unit tests + broken UX = wasted time. The harness exists to prevent that exact failure mode.
- Without behavioral tests, every stream becomes a coin flip until human review. With them, the agent self-certifies.

### What the harness provides (Stream 0.4)

- `test/behavior/driver.ts` — PTY-based driver: `spawnKobe()`, `sendKeys()`, `capture()`, `exit()`, with optional tmux backend for richer scenarios.
- `test/behavior/fake-engine.ts` — `FakeAIEngine implements AIEngine` so behavior tests don't depend on a real `claude` CLI or burn Anthropic tokens. Scripted event sequences, deterministic.
- `test/behavior/fixtures/` — reusable git fixture repos, sample task indices, etc.
- `bun run test:behavior` — runs every `test/behavior/**/*.test.ts`.
- `test/behavior/README.md` — author guide.

Once Stream 0.4 lands, every subsequent stream's "Done when" clause **must** include at least one behavior test that proves the user-visible feature works.

### When unit tests are still useful

Behavioral tests are slow (seconds each, not milliseconds) and harder to debug. Use unit tests for:
- Pure logic (parsers, serializers, state machines).
- Edge cases that are tedious to provoke through the UI (corrupt files, missing dirs, ENOENT, etc.).
- Anywhere a behavior test would be flakier or slower without proving more.

Unit tests are necessary. Behavior tests are sufficient.

## The Ralph Loop, formally

```
1. Read inputs (DESIGN.md + PLAN.md stream + upstream commits + refs).
2. Implement the stream's deliverables.
3. Run the four checks.
4. If any fails:
     a. Read the error.
     b. Fix the root cause (no --no-verify, no skipping tests, no try/catch swallowing).
     c. Goto 3.
     d. After 3 consecutive fails on the same root cause, stop and surface — don't spiral.
5. Commit.
6. Report: commit hash + what landed + any deviations + any "Done when" criteria you waived (with reason).
```

The "3-strike rule" is hard. Three failed attempts at the same fix = stop and report, don't keep trying. From CLAUDE.md.

---

## What agents commit

- One commit per stream (squash internally if needed before final commit).
- Commit message format:
  ```
  <type>: <stream id> — <one-line summary>

  <2-3 sentence body: what landed and why this is a complete unit>
  ```
  Where `<type>` is `chore` (scaffolding/config), `feat` (new functionality), `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `fix`. Match opencode's style.

- **NEVER** include `Co-Authored-By: Claude` or any AI attribution. No "Generated with Claude Code" footers. (From CLAUDE.md.)
- **NEVER** use `--no-verify` or skip hooks. If a hook fails, fix the underlying issue.
- **NEVER** delete files unless the user explicitly said "delete" or "remove" in the brief.

---

## What "Done when" means

Each stream in PLAN.md has a "Done when" line. That clause is **the success contract**.

- The agent must verify each "Done when" sub-clause with a command, not by inspection.
- If a "Done when" clause is ambiguous, the agent surfaces the ambiguity *before* committing — not after.
- "It looks right to me" is not done. "Test X asserts Y and passes" is done.

---

## Surfacing — when and how

Surface to the human (the user, via tool result text) when:

1. **Architectural ambiguity** — design decision not in DESIGN.md or PLAN.md.
2. **3-strike rule fired** — three failed fix attempts on the same root cause.
3. **Cross-stream conflict** — your stream needs a change in another stream's scope.
4. **Deviation from spec** — you intentionally did X instead of what PLAN.md said. Always say so explicitly.
5. **Acceptance waived** — you couldn't satisfy a "Done when" sub-clause and shipped without it. Say which one and why.

Do not surface for:
- Routine compiler errors you fixed.
- Minor file-naming choices within your scope.
- Commit message wording.
- Whether to run `bun install` (just run it).

---

## Team mode

A **team** is two or more agents running the same brief in parallel, each owning a non-overlapping slice. The user prefers teams over solo agents because parallelism compresses wall-clock and avoids serial bottlenecks.

Conventions for teams:

- Each team agent works in its own git worktree (`isolation: "worktree"`) to prevent cross-pollution.
- Each agent's slice is named (`Foundation/0.2`, `Foundation/0.3`, `Wave1/A`, etc.) and surfaces under that name.
- Agents on the same team **must not** edit files in another agent's slice. If they need a change there, they surface for coordination — they do not unilaterally cross the line.
- Each agent commits independently in its worktree branch.
- The orchestrator (the main Claude Code session, i.e. me) merges those branches back into `main` after both agents are green.
- A team is **done** when every member commits green and the orchestrator finishes the merge.

Communication between teammates, when needed, goes through:
- The file system (one team writes a fixture, the other consumes it).
- A shared "team scratchpad" file at `docs/teams/<wave>-<team>.md` (created by the first agent if needed; not committed to main unless useful long-term).
- The orchestrator (me) — explicit handoff via SendMessage if the runtime supports it, otherwise a pause-and-resume.

---

## What the orchestrator (main session) owns

- Spawning team agents with the right brief and `isolation: "worktree"`.
- Verifying the four checks pass on the merged result before declaring a wave done.
- Updating PLAN.md with completed-stream check marks.
- Surfacing wave-level decisions to the user (gate G0, G1, G2, G3, G4 sign-offs).
- Writing the next wave's team briefs after the previous gate is green.

## Anti-patterns the harness exists to prevent

- "I'll skip the test for now, it's just a small change." — No. The check is the contract.
- "The typecheck error is in someone else's code, not mine." — Surface and ask. Don't suppress with `// @ts-ignore`.
- "I committed even though dev crashed because the crash was unrelated." — No. If `bun run dev` fails, the commit fails.
- "I added `--no-verify` to bypass the hook." — Forbidden. Fix the hook or fix the underlying issue.
- "I rewrote the upstream stream's interface to make my impl easier." — Surface and coordinate. Don't unilaterally widen scope.
- "I ran out of ideas after one attempt." — Try at least 2 more before surfacing, but stop at 3.

---

## TL;DR for an agent

> Read DESIGN.md + your PLAN.md stream + this HARNESS.md. Implement. Run typecheck + lint + test + smoke. Loop on failures (max 3 strikes per root cause). Commit on green with a clean message and no AI attribution. Surface architectural calls, cross-stream needs, or 3-strike blockers — nothing else.
