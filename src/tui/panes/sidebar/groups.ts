/**
 * Pure list-shaping helpers for the sidebar pane.
 *
 * Wave 4.5 dropped repo grouping (Jackson decided "撤销 repo分组也太蠢了").
 * The sidebar is now a flat list of task rows split into two views:
 *
 *   - "Working session" (active) — `task.archived === false`
 *   - "Archives"                  — `task.archived === true`
 *
 * The user toggles between views with `[` / `]` and toggles the archived
 * flag on the cursor task with `a`. Repo / branch / worktree metadata
 * for the SELECTED task is shown in the topbar instead — see
 * `src/tui/component/topbar.tsx`.
 *
 * No grouping = no headers in the row list. {@link buildRows} returns a
 * filtered, ordered task list with each row's `flatIndex` so the
 * renderer can compare cursor positions without recounting.
 *
 * No reactivity here: pure functions over `readonly Task[]`. The Solid
 * component (`Sidebar.tsx`) wraps these in `createMemo` so they recompute
 * only when the upstream task signal or view changes.
