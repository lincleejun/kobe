/**
 * Central global keybindings for kobe.
 *
 * Stream D wires top-level shortcuts (palette, help, focus cycling, quit,
 * universal cancel). Pane-local bindings register their own scoped keymap
 * downstream — e.g. the chat composer owns its own `enter` / `shift+enter`,
 * the sidebar owns its `j/k`. **This file is global bindings only.**
 *
 * The shape:
 *   - `KobeKeymap` is a static, declarative table read by the help dialog
 *     and consumed by `useKobeKeybindings()` to register live handlers via
 *     the local `useBindings` hook (`src/tui/lib/keymap.tsx`).
 *   - `useKobeKeybindings()` is a Solid hook — call it inside a component
 *     mounted under `DialogProvider` + `CommandPaletteProvider`. It depends
 *     on those contexts. The bindings are torn down when the component
 *     unmounts (via `onCleanup` inside `useBindings`).
 *
 * Cmd vs Ctrl on macOS: terminals don't propagate the Command key to the
 * PTY. We register both `ctrl+k` and `alt+k` so the same key path works
 * across configurations (Option+K on macOS sends `ESC k` which our
 * keymap layer surfaces as `alt+k`). When users want a true `cmd+k`, they
 * configure their terminal to send Option+K or Ctrl+K instead.
 *
 * `tab` / `shift+tab` are reserved here for pane focus cycling but the
 * actual focus model lands in Wave 3. We register no-op handlers so the
 * keys aren't swallowed by other handlers in the meantime — once the
 * focus manager exists, we replace the `cmd` callbacks via this same
 * table.
