/**
 * Orchestrator core — Wave 2 Stream E.
 *
 * The glue layer. Owns the task lifecycle and dispatches to the three
 * Wave 1 modules: {@link AIEngine} (Stream A), `GitWorktreeManager`
 * (Stream B), and `TaskIndexStore` (Stream C). The whole upstream stack
 * is injected so behavior tests can swap in `FakeAIEngine` and a tmpdir
 * store without touching network or git auth.
 *
 * Design notes:
 *
 *   - **Status state machine.** Transitions are enforced explicitly here,
 *     not implicitly through `update({ status })`. `runTask` only fires
 *     when the task is `backlog` (or already done/error and being
 *     re-run); `pauseTask` only fires when in_progress; `archiveTask`
 *     accepts `done` or `canceled` and is allowed from any state. Bad
 *     transitions throw `IllegalTransitionError` so callers can branch.
 *
 *   - **Concurrency cap (4).** Per DESIGN §11.5 (resolved). When a 5th
 *     `runTask` is requested we reject with a typed `ConcurrencyCapError`
 *     rather than silently queueing — the UI surfaces the error and the
 *     user can pause something. Queueing belongs in a later stream.
 *
 *   - **Resume cwd back-channel.** `AIEngine.resume()` does not take a
 *     cwd — Stream A reads it from `opts.env.KOBE_RESUME_CWD` (else
 *     falls back to `process.cwd()`). The orchestrator runs in kobe's
 *     binary cwd, NOT the task's worktree, so we must always pass
 *     `KOBE_RESUME_CWD = task.worktreePath` when resuming. This is
 *     load-bearing and tested below.
 *
 *   - **Per-task event bus.** Events from `engine.stream(handle)` flow
 *     into a small in-memory bus (`Map<TaskId, Set<cb>>`). The chat
 *     pane subscribes per active task; on task switch the previous
 *     subscription is torn down. Subscribers are weak (we hold the cb,
 *     not the task), so a leaked subscription leaks one closure, not
 *     a worktree.
 *
 *   - **Solid integration.** `tasksSignal()` returns a Solid `Accessor`
 *     so `<Sidebar tasks={orch.tasksSignal()} />` works directly.
 *     Internally we keep a `createSignal<Task[]>` and rewrite it from a
 *     `TaskIndexStore.subscribe(cb)` listener. The store is the source
 *     of truth; the signal is a reactive mirror that wakes up on every
 *     mutation — without the orchestrator having to remember to call a
 *     `refreshSignal()` helper at every mutation point. The earlier
 *     "manual refresh after each mutation" pattern bit us when an
 *     unrelated code path mutated the store and the sidebar didn't
 *     redraw (Jackson's "task was done in JSON, sidebar still in
 *     Backlog" bug); the listener-based pattern is missable-by-design.
 *
 * What this file deliberately does NOT do:
 *
 *   - Persist event history (Claude Code's JSONL is the source of truth;
 *     `engine.readHistory(sessionId)` retrieves it).
 *   - Manage worktree teardown on archive (DESIGN §2.4 says we leave the
 *     worktree until the user explicitly removes it; we just stop the
 *     engine).
 *   - Branch lifecycle (we never delete branches).

   *     a redundant store notification.

   * No length cap is enforced here. {@link deriveTitleFromPrompt}
   * applies one when a title is auto-derived, but the user clicking
   * "rename" is signalling they want the value as typed. The sidebar
   * truncates on render (terminal column width clip), so an over-long
