# kobe (codename, rename later)

Goal: build a TUI that mimics Conductor's UX (multi-task AI orchestration), with Claude Code as the engine.

**Read in order before doing anything**:
1. [`HANDOFF.md`](./HANDOFF.md) — the briefing from the very first session.
2. [`docs/DESIGN.md`](./docs/DESIGN.md) — design philosophy, architecture, tech stack lock-in.
3. [`docs/PLAN.md`](./docs/PLAN.md) — Phase 0 → Phase 1 stream/wave plan.
4. [`docs/HARNESS.md`](./docs/HARNESS.md) — agent self-test contract. **Load-bearing.**

The architecture decisions are not obvious from the code (the code is mostly empty). The docs are the source of truth.

## Conventions

- `refs/` contains study material (symlinks + clones), gitignored. **Never edit anything inside `refs/`.**
- The user's name is Jackson (sma1lboy). Respond in the language they use (Chinese or English).
- Tech stack is locked: **TypeScript + `@opentui/core` + `@opentui/solid` + Solid.js + Bun**. Do not re-litigate.

## Operating model — agent teams + self-validation

This project does not run on solo subagents. It runs on **teams** of agents that self-validate.

### Team mode (canonical)

- Related streams group into a **team** (e.g. Foundation Team = streams 0.2 + 0.3 + 0.4).
- Each team member runs in its own git worktree (`isolation: "worktree"`) to prevent cross-pollution.
- Each member commits independently in its worktree branch.
- The orchestrator (the main Claude Code session) merges the branches back to `main` only after every member is green.
- Teammates don't edit files outside their slice. If they need a change there, they surface — they don't unilaterally widen scope.
- A team is **done** when every member commits green and the merge lands.

The named teams so far (see `docs/PLAN.md` for full breakdowns):
- **Foundation Team** — streams 0.2, 0.3, 0.4. Lifts the opencode shell, defines core types, builds the behavior test harness.
- **Wave 1 Team** — streams A, B, C, D. Engine impl, worktree manager, task index, theme/keybindings.
- **Wave 3 Team** — streams G, H, I, J. The four panes that flank the chat.

Sequential stages (0.1, E, F, K, L, M) are run as solo agents — but still under the same harness contract.

### Agent self-validation (the rule that matters)

> Tests are not just typecheck and `bun test`. **Tests include the agent running the actual product end-to-end and asserting visible behavior.** No human is in the loop for verification.

Concretely, every stream that produces a user-visible change must include a **behavioral self-test**:

1. The agent spawns kobe (or a stream-scoped subset) under PTY/tmux via the Stream 0.4 driver.
2. Sends keystrokes as a real user would.
3. Captures the visible screen.
4. Asserts on visible state (text, layout, status badges).

If the agent only ran `bun typecheck` and `bun test`, it has not validated the work. It has validated some functions. The bar is: *the agent has proven, by running the binary, that the product behaves correctly.* Without that proof, no commit.

Full contract is in `docs/HARNESS.md`. Read it before spawning any team.

### What surfaces to the human (Jackson)

Bring to Jackson only:
- Architectural decisions not in DESIGN.md.
- 3-strike blockers (three failed fixes on the same root cause).
- Cross-stream conflicts that need scope adjudication.
- Wave-gate sign-offs (G0, G1, G2, G3, G4).
- Intentional deviations from PLAN.md.

Do not bring:
- Routine compiler errors.
- "Did this commit go through?" — check with `git log` first.
- Whether to run `bun install`. Just run it.
- File-naming choices within stream scope.

## Hard rules (non-negotiable)

### Commits

- Commit at the end of each stream when the agent is green. The user has authorized per-stream commits in advance.
- Commit message: `<type>: <stream id> — <one-line summary>` plus a 2-3 sentence body.
- **NEVER** include `Co-Authored-By: Claude` or any AI/Anthropic/Claude attribution. No "Generated with Claude Code" footers. (From the workspace-level `/Users/jacksonc/i/CLAUDE.md`.)
- **NEVER** use `--no-verify`, `--no-gpg-sign`, or skip hooks. If a hook fails, fix the underlying issue.

### Deletion

- **NEVER** delete files, branches, worktrees, or run `rm -rf` unless the user explicitly says "delete" or "remove" *in the same conversation turn*.
- This includes: cleanup of stale worktrees, "fixing" the layout by removing files, anything destructive.
- If a task seems to require deletion, surface and ask first.

### Scope

- A stream agent only edits files within its declared slice. Cross-stream changes are surfaced, not silently made.
- 3-strike rule: same root cause failed three times → stop and surface.
- Max-depth rule: 3+ levels of sub-investigation → surface findings before going deeper.

### Don't touch

- `refs/` — study material, read-only forever.
- Other agents' worktree slices — coordinate via the orchestrator.
- Workspace-level config (`/Users/jacksonc/i/CLAUDE.md`, global git config, etc.).

## Phase status

- **Phase 0**: foundation. Streams 0.1 (bootstrap, solo), then Foundation Team (0.2 + 0.3 + 0.4) in parallel.
- **Phase 1**: build the 5-pane Conductor-shaped TUI. Waves 1–4 per `docs/PLAN.md`.
- **Phase 2**: deferred. Conductor-as-backend mode. Hook points designed in; impl not yet.

Update this section's status as gates G0–G4 close. See PLAN.md for the canonical state.
