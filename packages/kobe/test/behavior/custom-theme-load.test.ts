/**
 * Behavior test for user-installable themes.
 *
 * What this proves end-to-end:
 *
 *   1. Dropping a JSON file into `<KOBE_HOME_DIR>/.kobe/themes/<name>.json`
 *      causes kobe to register `<name>` in the theme registry at boot
 *      (via `loadUserThemes()` -> `addTheme()` in `startApp`).
 *   2. The settings dialog's theme picker shows the user theme alongside
 *      bundled themes — i.e. `themeCtx.all()` returns both sets, and
 *      `settings-dialog.tsx`'s `themeNames` memo lists them.
 *
 * What we DON'T assert:
 *   - The rendered colors. opentui paints RGBA into a cell buffer; the
 *     PTY capture is plain text. See settings-theme-switch.test.ts for
 *     the same caveat. The presence of the theme name in the picker is
 *     a faithful proxy: if it shows up, registration ran and the
 *     SolidJS reactivity flowed into the picker.
 *   - That switching to the user theme persists across boots. The KV
 *     write path is shared with bundled themes and already covered by
 *     `settings-theme-switch.test.ts`.
 *
 * Hermeticity: same pattern as settings-theme-switch.test.ts. We set
 * both `HOME` (so the KV store at `~/.config/kobe/state.json` lands in
 * tmp) and `KOBE_HOME_DIR` (so the loader and task index store also
 * live in tmp).
