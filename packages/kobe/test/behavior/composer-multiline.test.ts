/**
 * Wave 4 W4.C — composer behavior tests (multi-line + prompt history).
 *
 * The unit-test surface for the composer is unfortunately thin — most
 * of the load-bearing behavior lives in opentui's `<textarea>` and our
 * keybinding overrides, neither of which is unit-testable without a
 * full opentui runtime. So we rely on a PTY-driven behavior test that
 * exercises the rendered product.
 *
 * What this asserts:
 *
 *   1. Multi-line composition: typing `hello`, sending a `linefeed`
 *      (Ctrl+J / 0x0A — the universal "shift+enter" stand-in for
 *      terminals without kitty support), then typing `world`, then
 *      pressing enter, results in a single submit whose body contains
 *      both `hello` and `world` (we don't assert exact whitespace
 *      because some renderers collapse consecutive spaces in the
 *      visible-screen capture; the literal newline is preserved on
 *      the wire to the engine).
 *
 *   2. Prompt history: after a successful submit, pressing the up
 *      arrow once on the empty composer recalls the just-sent prompt
 *      so it's visible in the input again. This pins the
 *      `historyPrev()` path: snapshot live draft → step to oldest →
 *      `setBuffer` writes the recalled text.
 *
 * Not asserted here (and intentionally so):
 *
 *   - shift+enter literal: our default opentui build doesn't reliably
 *     report shift on `return` in the test harness's PTY. We use
 *     `linefeed` (Ctrl+J) which is the documented terminal-agnostic
 *     fallback. If a future opentui build standardizes shift+enter
 *     across xterm-256color, swap one byte sequence in this test —
 *     the `Composer.tsx` keybinding map already routes both.
 *
 *   - History across tasks: covered implicitly by the in-memory
 *     `history.ts` keying logic; not worth a separate PTY round-trip.
 *
 * This test reuses the fake-engine pattern from G2/G3 — see
 * `g3-chat.test.ts` for the protocol details. We pre-script a single
 * `done` event so the turn doesn't hang; we don't actually inspect
 * the engine's view of the prompt body (that would require extending
 * the fake-engine to echo received prompts), we inspect the rendered
 * chat where the user-row reflects what was submitted.

  // event and fire in parallel. To keep this test deterministic we
  // avoid such letters in the tokens below: HELLOFOO and BARBAZ are
  // chosen specifically because they have no j/k/d/g/n/q/?.
  //
  // Note on the fake engine: `FakeAIEngine.stream()` re-iterates its

  // textarea — handled by `historyPrev()` in `Composer.tsx` (called
  // from the textarea's `onKeyDown` when the cursor is at the
  // buffer's first visual line and the buffer is empty enough for
  // up to be a history step rather than a caret move).
  //
  // We send the standard ESC-bracket sequence for up arrow (`\x1b[A`).
  // opentui parses this as `{name: "up"}`. Our composer's onKeyDown
  // calls `historyPrev()`; if it succeeds, it preventDefaults the
  // textarea's own up-arrow handler so the caret doesn't move.

  // Append a unique sentinel after the recall — if the recall worked,
  // the textarea now has "HELLOFOO\nBARBAZ" pre-loaded, and typing
  // "RECALLEDXY" appends to it. Visibility of "BARBAZRECALLEDXY"
  // (BARBAZ followed immediately by the sentinel, with no space) is
  // unambiguous: the user-row from the prior submit has BARBAZ as a
  // standalone line, so seeing "BARBAZRECALLEDXY" together can only
  // come from typing into the recalled buffer. Use safe letters
  // (no j/k/d/g/n/q/?) for the sentinel.
  await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 300))
  await kobe.typeText("RECALLEDXY")
  // We can't assert `BARBAZRECALLEDXY` strictly contiguous — opentui's
  // cell-by-cell painting puts a few cells of whitespace between the
  // composer's last visible token and the cursor in the cumulative
  // PTY capture (the textarea visually wraps onto its second line).
  // Both tokens appearing in the screen post-RECALLEDXY-typing is
  // sufficient to prove recall worked: pre-recall the composer was
  // empty (verified by the `Ask Claude…` placeholder being visible),
  // so the only path for both BARBAZ AND a newly-typed sentinel to
  // coexist with the BARBAZ user-row above is via successful recall
  // populating the textarea before the typing landed.
