/**
 * In-memory bookkeeping for live Claude Code subprocesses.
 *
 * Modeled after `refs/opcode/src-tauri/src/process/registry.rs` but
 * stripped down: opcode tracks `run_id`s tied to a SQLite agent table
 * and persists live output for late-subscriber UIs. We don't need any
 * of that — kobe pumps the stream directly into per-task event buses
 * (see Stream E in PLAN.md), and the orchestrator's task index is
 * already on disk. This registry exists for one reason: **stop()**
 * needs to find the child process by `sessionId` to send signals.
 *
 * We register on session id (not on a synthetic key) because the
 * canonical {@link SessionHandle} only exposes `sessionId`, and we
 * want `stop(handle)` to be a single map lookup. The session id is
 * not known until the `system.init` event arrives — registration
 * therefore happens *after* spawn, inside ClaudeCodeLocal.

   * If a prior entry exists, distinguish two cases:
   *
   *   - **Live duplicate** — the prior proc is still running. This is
   *     a real conflict (caller is racing two starts on the same
   *     sessionId). Throw — the second call must back off.
   *
   *   - **Stale duplicate** — the prior proc has already exited, but
   *     its cleanup didn't unregister (timing race between the parse
   *     IIFE's finally and our engine.stop, or a partial failure that
   *     left the entry orphaned). Treat as "registry empty": drop
   *     the stale handle, register the fresh one. The live process
   *     wins; the dead one was going to be unregistered anyway.
   *
   * Without the stale-entry recovery, a single missed cleanup (often
   * from a transient throw deep in the parse pipeline) makes every
   * subsequent `claude --resume <sid>` fail forever, because the
   * sessionId is reused across resumes — the registry slot is
   * load-bearing for the entire lifetime of the session, not just one
   * subprocess.
