/**
 * SessionPump — the per-(Task, ChatTab) consumer of `engine.stream()`.
 *
 * One pump runs per active ChatTab. The pump drains the engine's
 * async iterator, fans every event out to subscribers via the
 * caller-supplied `dispatch` callback, and watches for two special
 * shapes:
 *
 *   1. **Pause-tool starts** (`ExitPlanMode`, `AskUserQuestion`).
 *      `detectUserInputFromEngineEvent` classifies the `tool.start`
 *      event; the pump records the request into the
 *      {@link PendingInputBroker}, fires a synthetic
 *      `user_input.request` event, kills the engine, and stops
 *      draining. The task stays `in_progress` while the user thinks
 *      — `Orchestrator.respondToInput` is what resumes the session
 *      once the user answers.
 *   2. **Terminal `done` / `error`.** Buffered, not dispatched
 *      inline. The orchestrator wants engine cleanup + store status
 *      writes to settle before subscribers react to `done`, so the
 *      pump returns the terminal event and the orchestrator
 *      dispatches it after its own post-pump bookkeeping. See the
 *      `pumps.delete` / `store.update` block in
 *      `Orchestrator.runPumpAndCleanup`.
 *
 * Everything that touches Orchestrator-owned state (the handles
 * map, the pumps map, the task-status state machine, the run-state
 * signal) lives on the caller, not on the pump. The pump's job is
 * "drive this one session to a stopping point and tell me what
 * happened." That makes it unit-testable with a fake engine + an
 * in-memory broker + a callback that records dispatches — no
 * Orchestrator instance required.
 *
 * Naming:
 *   See `CONTEXT.md` § Language → "SessionPump." Aliases ("stream
 *   loop," "event driver," "runner") are listed in _Avoid_ and
 *   shouldn't show up in code or docs.
