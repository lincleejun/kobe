/**
 * Single class that wraps every "ask claude for a piece of task
 * metadata" call kobe makes. Today: branch slugs (shipped) +
 * worktree slugs and titles (API only — not yet wired into the
 * orchestrator's main flow).
 *
 * Why a class instead of N exported functions:
 *
 *   - **One init seam.** `findClaudeBinary` is run once per instance,
 *     lazily on first method call, and the resolved path (or `null`
 *     for "binary missing, give up") is cached. Startup is not
 *     blocked: an instance can be constructed eagerly and the probe
 *     fires only when the orchestrator first asks for a suggestion.
 *
 *   - **One spawn + sanitize seam.** Each suggestion is a
 *     timeout-bounded `claude -p` shell-out that resolves to either
 *     a sanitized string or `null`. The instruction text and
 *     sanitizer differ per metadata kind; the runner doesn't.
 *
 *   - **Injectable.** `Orchestrator` accepts a `metadataSuggester` in
 *     its deps. Tests pass a fake that returns canned values without
 *     touching the network or the user's `claude` install.
 *
 * Failure mode contract (matches the previous standalone helper):
 * NEVER throw, NEVER block the user-visible flow. Anything that goes
 * wrong (binary missing, prompt empty, timeout, claude error,
 * unparseable response) collapses to `null`. Callers ALWAYS have a
 * deterministic fallback (deriveTitleFromPrompt for titles, ulid
 * suffix for branches) so a `null` is never a hard failure for the
 * user.
 *
 * TODO(stabilize): each `claude -p` invocation writes a JSONL
 * session under `~/.claude/projects/<cwd-encoded>/<uuid>.jsonl`, so
 * we leak one tiny session per suggestion. To clean those up we'd
 * need to switch this helper to `--output-format stream-json`,
 * capture the session id from the `system.init` event, then call
 * `engine.deleteHistory(sid)` after the rename completes. Tracked
 * outside this consolidation.
