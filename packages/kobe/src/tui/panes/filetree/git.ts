/**
 * Thin git wrappers for the file tree pane.
 *
 * Two narrow operations the pane needs:
 *   1. {@link listFiles} — `git ls-files --cached --others --exclude-standard --full-name`,
 *      a flat list of every gitignore-respecting file in the worktree.
 *   2. {@link statusFiles} — `git status --porcelain`, parsed into a tiny
 *      `{ path, status }` shape carrying the single-char status the pane
 *      colour-codes (M / A / D / ?).
 *
 * Implementation is intentionally separate from `src/orchestrator/worktree/git.ts`
 * — that module is owned by Stream B and is wired into worktree
 * lifecycle invariants (throws `GitCommandError`, etc.). Sharing it
 * would couple a pane to orchestrator-side code we should not touch
 * cross-stream. This wrapper is a few dozen lines of thin spawn glue
 * that matches Stream B's pattern but lives in the pane's slice.
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 *   - We use Node's `child_process.spawnSync`. The brief says to "use
 *     `Bun.spawnSync`, matching B's pattern" — but B's actual file uses
 *     `child_process.spawnSync` because the test runner (vitest) hosts
 *     under Node and `Bun` is undefined there. Matching B's *real*
 *     pattern keeps the unit tests runnable under both runtimes. The
 *     production binary runs under Bun, where Node's `child_process`
 *     also works (Bun ships a compatible shim). Same trade-off, same
 *     answer.
 *   - Args always pass as an array. Never a shell string. `shell: false`
 *     defends against any upstream layer that might flip the default.
 *   - `cwd` is required on every call. The pane never relies on
 *     `process.cwd()` because tasks run in different worktrees
 *     concurrently.
 *   - On non-zero exit we throw — the pane shows an error empty-state.
 *     This mirrors the orchestrator's behaviour and avoids silently
 *     rendering stale data.
 *   - We export `spawnGit` as a named symbol so unit tests can mock it
 *     via `vi.spyOn` (vitest cannot stub a top-level `import` directly,
 *     but it can stub a property of the same module's exported object).
