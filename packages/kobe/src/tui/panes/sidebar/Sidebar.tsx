/**
 * kobe sidebar pane (Stream F → Wave 4.A → Wave 4.5).
 *
 * Wave 4.5 reverses Wave 4.A's repo grouping; the list is NOT grouped
 * per project. Instead it renders as two flat sections — the PROJECTS
 * (repo-root `main` rows) on top, a divider, then ALL the TASKS
 * (worktrees) flat below (Jackson's call). Two views switch with `[`/`]`:
 *

 *   └───────────────────────────────────────┘
 *
 * Each section gets a small BOLD CAPS header + trailing rule. A PROJECT
 * row is a compact single line: ★ + repo name, with the repo
 * dir (home-abbreviated) on the right — or an animated `working` chip
 * while that repo-root session is live. A TASK row is a small two-line
 * card: line 1 = status badge + title + a `working` chip while the
 * engine streams; line 2 = the branch (or a status word when the task
 * has no branch yet) + the `+N −M` uncommitted-change chip. Tasks carry
 * a trailing blank line so each reads as its own card; projects sit
 * tight. The cursor row gets a left accent ▌ and a subtle background
 * tint; the active row keeps a dimmer ▌ when the cursor moves off it.
 *
 * Loading is driven by `task.status === "in_progress"` (the Tasks pane's
 * only liveness signal — chatRunState is unwired there) or a live engine
 * handle when the outer monitor passes chatRunState: the badge animates
 * (braille spinner) and a `working` chip appears.
 *
 * The active view shows tasks where `task.archived === false`; the
 * archived view shows the rest. `a` on a row toggles its archived flag
 * (non-destructive; the worktree, the branch, and the chat history all
 * stay).
 *
 * The sidebar width is a documented hardcode (CLAUDE.md "flex-first,
 * hardcode last"): convention rationale — matches the direct-tmux Tasks pane
 * navigator width, wide enough for view tabs and useful task titles.
 *
 * Status badges (●○) still render on per-task rows as a visual hint of
 * the underlying `task.status` (the orchestrator's concurrency cap and
 * lifecycle still depend on it), but the sidebar no longer groups
 * by status, by repo, or by anything else — only the active-view
 * filter applies.
 *
 * Cursor / nav: a Solid signal `cursorIndex` indexes the *flat*
 * navigable task list within the active view. View switches reset the
 * cursor to 0. `enter` selects, `d` deletes, `a` toggles archive,
 * `M` starts local merge,
 * `[`/`]` switches view, `g g` jumps to top, `G` jumps to bottom.
 *
 * Reactivity: every prop is an `Accessor`. We never `.map()` arrays in
 * JSX — `For` is used so Solid keeps the row list reactive. The view
 * filter and row build recompute via `createMemo` only when their
 * inputs change.
 *
 * Focus: `props.focused` defaults to `() => true` so embedders that
 * don't yet thread the focus signal still get a working sidebar.
