/**
 * Wave 4 W4.C — multi-line chat composer.
 *
 * What this owns:
 *
 *   - The prefix glyph (`>` / `…`).
 *   - The multi-line `<textarea>` input with custom keybindings:
 *       * plain enter           → submit
 *       * shift+enter           → newline (kitty / CSI-u terminals)
 *       * ctrl+J / linefeed     → newline (universal fallback)
 *   - Per-key prompt history (in-memory): up arrow at line 1 recalls
 *     the previous submission, down arrow at the last line walks
 *     forward (and falls off the end into the live draft).
 *   - The placeholder cadence — "Ask Claude…" by default, "(streaming
 *     — wait for done)" while a turn is in flight, "(no task — press n
 *     to create)" when no task is selected.
 *   - Bracketed paste support — opentui's textarea handles multi-line
 *     paste natively, no flicker, no per-character replay. We don't
 *     have to do anything; the renderable's `handlePaste` decodes
 *     bytes and inserts in one shot.
 *   - Image paste — two entry points, one shared core. (a) Bracketed-
 *     paste with `metadata.mimeType` starting with `image/` is caught
 *     by our `onPaste` override and routed to the
 *     {@link ImagePasteRegistry}. (b) `Ctrl+V` reads the OS clipboard
 *     directly (macOS `osascript`; Linux/Windows are stubs that
 *     surface a "not yet supported" hint) for terminals that don't
 *     forward image bytes through bracketed paste — which is most of
 *     them today. Either way the user sees a `[Image #N]` placeholder
 *     in the textarea; on submit, tokens expand to ` @<absPath> ` so
 *     the engine sees an `@path` reference (the only image-input
 *     channel the `claude` CLI exposes). See `image-paste.ts` for the
 *     why-it-must-be-`@path` lecture.
 *
 * What this does NOT own (deferred):
 *
 *   - Mention completion (`@filename`).
 *   - Slash commands inside the composer.
 *   - Drag-drop file paste (no Tauri equivalent in pure TTY).
 *   - Linux / Windows clipboard image readers (stubs return null).
 *   - Auto-GC of `~/.kobe/pasted-images/`.
 *   - Cross-session history persistence (in-memory only for v1).
 *
 * Architectural notes:
 *
 *   - The textarea is the source of truth for the buffer. We expose
 *     changes to the parent via `onDraftChange` so it stays informed
 *     (the parent uses the draft to gate the empty-buffer "enter
 *     toggles last tool" behavior). We also pull the parent's draft
 *     into the textarea on mount and when it diverges (e.g. parent
 *     clears it after submit).
 *   - History navigation only fires when the cursor is at the
 *     buffer's first line (going up) or last line (going down). In
 *     between, up/down move the caret like a normal multi-line editor.
 *     The opentui defaults already handle that — we just preventDefault
 *     in the cases where we want history to win.
 *   - Submit clears the textarea synchronously. The parent's
 *     `onSubmit` will then call back with `setDraft("")`, which our
 *     reactive sync turns into a no-op (already cleared).
 *
 * Props contract: extends the original {@link ComposerProps} from the
 * Wave 4 split — every new prop is optional so {@link Chat.tsx} keeps
 * working without changes.
