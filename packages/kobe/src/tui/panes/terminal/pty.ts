/**
 * Terminal pane PTY abstraction (Stream J).
 *
 * `TaskPty` is the unit kobe's terminal pane consumes. One instance ==
 * one shell scoped to one task's worktree. The implementation is
 * swappable via the `BACKEND` strategy below; today we ship a tmux
 * backend by default plus a mock backend for tests.
 *
 * # Why tmux (and not node-pty)
 *
 * Stream 0.4 documented in `test/behavior/driver.ts`: `node-pty`'s
 * `onData` callback does NOT fire under Bun 1.3.x. We re-verified that
 * during the J spike — `pty.spawn()` succeeds (no error), but data
 * never streams back. Stream 0.4 worked around it by spawning kobe
 * (under bun) as a subprocess of vitest (under node), so node-pty ran
 * under node. The terminal pane runs INSIDE kobe (under bun), so that
 * trick is unavailable to us.
 *
 * Three backends were considered:
 *
 *   1. node-pty inside bun                  — broken (data never emits)
 *   2. Bun.spawn with stdio:pipe            — works, but not a real PTY.
 *      Many CLIs (interactive `claude`, `vim`, `htop`) detect non-TTY
 *      stdout via `isatty()` and degrade or refuse. The terminal pane
 *      is supposed to run *anything* the user types — pretending to
 *      be a tty for half the world's commands is a stable footgun.
 *   3. tmux                                 — proven (agent-deck uses
 *      it: see `refs/agent-deck/internal/tmux/`). Real PTY semantics,
 *      session persists across kobe restarts, naturally maps "one pty
 *      per task" → "one session per task", trivial capture protocol
 *      (`tmux capture-pane -p`).
 *
 * tmux wins. Cost: a tmux binary on the host. We surface the dependency
 * in the README; on macOS most developers already have it from `brew
 * install tmux`.
 *
 * # Backend swap mechanism
 *
 * `TaskPty` is a class with concrete shape. A second concrete class
 * (`MockTaskPty`) implements the same surface for tests. To swap real
 * backends without rewriting `Terminal.tsx`, set
 * `process.env.KOBE_TERMINAL_BACKEND=mock` (used only by tests; not a
 * supported user toggle) before constructing the registry; production
 * always gets tmux. If we ever need a `Bun.spawn` fallback for hosts
 * without tmux, add a third class implementing the same interface and
 * branch in `createTaskPty`.
 *
 * # Lifecycle
 *
 * Construct → `start()` is implicit (the constructor spawns). The
 * caller drives `write()` for keystrokes, registers an `onData()` listener
 * for output (called with newly-arrived chunks), polls `capture()` for
 * the visible scrollback, and calls `kill()` when the task is archived.
 * `resize(cols, rows)` is forwarded to tmux as a window resize.
 *
 * # `onData` semantics
 *
 * tmux doesn't push data — we have to poll `capture-pane`. To keep the
 * abstraction looking pushy (so a future `Bun.spawn` backend can drop
 * in without changing the consumer), we run a poll loop at
 * `POLL_INTERVAL_MS` and emit a chunk whenever the pane content
 * changes. Listeners receive *full* pane snapshots, not deltas; that
 * matches what tmux gives us and is plenty for plain-text scrollback.
 * The `Terminal.tsx` consumer treats the latest snapshot as the
 * scrollback view.
 *
 * Edge cases handled:
 *   - tmux not installed: constructor throws synchronously with a
 *     human-readable error.
 *   - session name collision: we use the task id, but allow callers
 *     to override (the registry passes the task id as session name).
 *     If a session with that name already exists, we attach to it
 *     rather than fail — matches the "kept alive while in_progress"
 *     spec; if the user re-mounts the pane while the task is still
 *     active, they get the live session back.
 *   - kill() races: idempotent; subsequent calls are no-ops.
